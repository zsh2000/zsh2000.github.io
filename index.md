## About me
I’m Shuhong Zheng and I’m now a 4th-year (final-year) undergraduate student majoring computer science at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University, China.

Currently, I’m working as an intern student at [STRUCT Team](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Jiaying Liu](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/people/liujiaying.html).

I’m interested in computer vision and human motion topics.
